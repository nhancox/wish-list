# wish-list

## NOTE

This project is currently being upgraded for v2.0.0. My intention is purely to
add a certain level of polish that is more inline with my current standards. Do
not consider any non-tagged commits to be fully-tested.

## Description

This project is a simple wish list implemented with the MEAN stack.

Using a local MongoDB instance and a RESTful API combined with an Angular
front-end, you can manage the items that are on your wish list.

On page load, your wish list appears. You are able to add, edit or delete items
with the (required) name and (optional) notes fields. The input forms utilize
Angular validation.

To better expose project structure and coding practices, the Gulp and .env files
have been exposed in the repo â€” only the node_module, editor and compiled build
files are in gitignore.

All technologies used: HTML5, Bootstrap 3, Angular, UI-Router, JavaScript,
Express, Node.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, Gulp.
